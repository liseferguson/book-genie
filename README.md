BookGenie is an app that allows users to exchange books with others in their area. Users can create a profile with basic information (including: their name, zipcode, and neighborhood) and a library that they can list all of their books in. Books can be added and deleted as needed. 

Users can search for books by title in the home page search bar. If there is a match, the user with the title in their library is returned. The first user can look at their basic information and other books in their library, and contact them via email if they want to request to borrow the book.

Users can also choose to browse the libraries of all other users in a scrollable, list-style format.
